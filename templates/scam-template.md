# Phishing

## Summary
Phishing is a social engineering scam in which attackers impersonate legitimate organizations or trusted entities to trick victims into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, or personal identification details. It is typically delivered via email, SMS, or social media and directs victims to fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate services. Phishing is one of the most widespread and scalable scam types globally and often serves as the entry point for larger fraud schemes and account takeovers.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Contact**  
   The victim receives a message appearing to originate from a trusted organization (e.g., bank, government agency, employer, technology provider).

2. **Trust Establishment / Urgency Trigger**  
   The message claims urgent action is required (account suspension, suspicious login, payment issue, security verification).

3. **Redirection to Fraudulent Infrastructure**  
   The victim is directed to a spoofed website or form that visually resembles the legitimate service.

4. **Data Harvesting**  
   The victim enters login credentials, payment details, or personal identification information.

5. **Exploitation Phase**  
   Stolen information is used for account takeover, financial fraud, identity theft, or sold on underground marketplaces.
